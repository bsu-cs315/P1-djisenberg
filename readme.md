## Project Report

### Reflection
I feel like this iteration was noteworth for 3 reasons. First, it has taught me to be more vigilant with due dates. I was thinking I was doing quite well with iteration 1 when in fact iteration 1 was already past due, and iteration 2 was just around the corner! The second noteworthy thing that came up was my difficulty with getting different nodes to communicate with each other. For example, I was able to easily identify WHEN a collision occured, but I had great difficulty in identifying what exactly a particular body had collided with. The third area of note was that this whole process is starting to feel fun and rewarding, in much the same way eating crab is. Like eating crab, programming and game development consist of periods of frustration (crabs have stubborn shells that are meant to prevent other animals from eating said crab) followed by short bursts of extreme satisfaction (like when you finally open up a leg segment and get a long, glorious strip of meat).
