## Project Report

### Reflection
This release made me think about how easy it can be to become overconfident with a project. After thinking I had more or less mastered (or at least become reasonably competant) in the basics of Godot to make a very simple game, I was surprised when it took me several hours to implement any kind of functional title screen. The simple act of having a seperate scene with a button that, when pressed, would make another scene appear on the screen, presented me with a monumental headache that required multiple different attempts and iterations to solve. It has also reinforced my belief that I am fundamentally missing something with regards to the intended architecture of the engine and its use. Surely the ability to transfer information from one node to another can't be as restricted as it currently feels to me!
